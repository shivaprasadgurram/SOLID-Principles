# SOLID-Principles

In this repository I demonstrated what are SOLID principles and how we can implement them.

Introduction: 

SOLID is a popular set of design principles that are used in object-oriented software development. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle.

In each subpackage you can see a .txt file and which describes about that principle.

Hope it helps you!
